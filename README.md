Domain Intelligible Model

We adapt sparse Generalized Additive Model (sparse GAM), to be applicable to the task of variable selection in high dimensional, microbiome (-omics) dataset. GAMs are less general in comparison to "fully" nonparametric models, but have a notable advantage of being readily interpretable and easier to estimate using a simple backfitting algorithm. Recently, standard additive models have been successfully applied in the biomedical domain, and they can be naturally extended to include various interactions among predictors.
